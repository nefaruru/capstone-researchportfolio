","Colostrum is a more concentrated form of breast milk with lots of immunological properties. ","Breastfeeding is something that is encouraged in my community. "," When an infant is breastfed it is difficult to tell how much milk is consumed.","Breastfeeding helps a women lose weight that was gained during pregnancy. ","Mothers should cover their breasts from public view when breastfeeding in public places. "," Breast milk is composed of low fat and low protein."," Breastfeeding is something that should primarily be done at home. ","A motherâ€™s milk supply does not actually come in until about 1-3 days after birth. ","You are sitting at a table in a coffee shop. A woman walks in and sits at the table next to you and begins breastfeeding an infant. This makes you feel uncomfortable."," Breastfeeding is correlated with a lowered risk of breast and ovarian cancer for the mother."," Most people in my community bottle feed their infants. ","Breastfeeding is a cheap food source in comparison to formula.","Formula is created to have nutritional value for infants, because of this breastfeeding is no longer necessary."," Expecting future mothers to breastfeed places unnecessary stress on them since not all women are able to produce enough milk."
